![header](https://github.com/infosupport/xamarin-security-scanner/blob/master/Docs/header.png?raw=true)

A tool to find security vulnerabilities in Xamarin.Android apps. It finds vulnerabilities by analyzing the source code (SAST).

It is inspired by and contains code from QARK (Quick Android Review Kit).

## Getting Started

The quickest way to get started is to use Docker.


```
git clone <project_url>
cd xamarin-security-scanner
docker build ./XamarinSecurityScanner -t xamarin-security-scanner
docker run -v <absolute_path_to_project>:/project xamarin-security-scanner
```

Another option is to install .NET Core 3.1, and run the following commands:

```
git clone <project_url>
cd xamarin-security-scanner
dotnet run --project .\XamarinSecurityScanner\XamarinSecurityScanner.App --path <path_to_project>
```

Example output:
